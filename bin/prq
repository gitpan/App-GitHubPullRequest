Install it by just typing in these few lines in your shell:

    $ curl -L http://cpanmin.us | perl - --self-upgrade
    $ cpanm App::GitHubPullRequest

=head1 CAVEATS

If you don't have C<git config github.user> and C<git config github.password>
set in your git config, it will use unauthenticated API requests, which has
a rate-limit of 60 requests. If you add your user + password info it should
allow 5000 requests before you hit the limit.

You must be standing in a directory that is a git dir and that directory must
have a remote that points to github.com for the tool to work.
